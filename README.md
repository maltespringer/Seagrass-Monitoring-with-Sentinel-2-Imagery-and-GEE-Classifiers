# Seagrass-Monitoring-with-Sentinel-2-Imagery-and-GEE-Classifiers
Here the seagrass Z.noltii and Z.marina species in the North-Frisian Wadden Sea were analyzed by processing Sentinel-2 imagery from 2018 to 2023. 
Athmospherically corrected images were classified in Google Earth Engine by applying various machine learning classifiers. 
The spatial distribution of the resulting data were analyzed by multinominal logistic regression analysis. 
Multiple plots were created to visualize the results.
